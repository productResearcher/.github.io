## Tests
### Testing simple static website is fairly easy, I focused testing the UI.
#### Test 1: The GUI design:
I compared the reference design with my developed website.
I checked all the sections are presented the same way as the design.

#### Test 2: The fonts.
I checked the font size, font spacing and colour to make sure everything is reproduced as the design. 

#### Test 3: Links.
I checked the links work fine, and looked out for broken links.

#### Test 4: Spelling.
I checked for spelling and grammar errors.

#### Test 5: Images.
I checkd the image links both on the local and remote server.

#### Test 6: Scroll bar.
I checked the scroll bar carefully and to mak sure it all works as expected.

#### Test 7: Errors.
I checked to make sure it is an error free webpage, this includes UI and Console inspecttion.

Corrected all errors that came up in W3 validator.
