                        &nbsp;
                        <h3>Are you qualified to give injectables?</h3>
                        <p>All practitioners at M Aesthetic doctors, are doctors and have a Medical Degree from a University in the UK. We have all had extensive medical training, in line with the General Medical Council. We adhere to strict medical guidance which puts the safety of the client first.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>After the consultation, do I have to undertake the treatment?</h4>
                        <p>
                        We provide a free consultation so that you don’t feel pressured at any point to undertake the treatment. We are happy to make suggestions of what we think and do not think is achievable. Your welcome to a consultation pre-treatment and payment will only be made immediately prior to the agreed treatment.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Anti-aging </h3>
                        <h4>What is Botox &reg;?</h4>
                        <p>Botox &reg; is the most commonly known brand name for Botullinium Toxin A. It is a prescription only medication, which comes as an injectable. It is used for a variety of things, but its main effects are on temporarily relaxing muscles, which in aesthetics can help fade the signs of aging, e.g. reduce wrinkles.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>How does Botox &reg; work?</h4>
                        <p>It acts by temporarily relaxing the muscles. We usually use it in the muscles of the face, where signs of aging are visible.  We will tailor the amount we use depending on which part of the face we are injecting and how deep your lines are.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Who can have Botox &reg; and how long does it last?</h4>
                        <p>Botox is suitable for those over the age of 18 years, who (after consultation), are shown to have a potential cosmetic benefit post treatment. It is not suitable in Pregnancy/breast-feeding, those under the age of 18 (for aesthetic treatments), those </p>
                        <p>on certain medications, those allergic and those with certain medical conditions. These can be discussed at consultation.</p>
                        <p>The treatment can last for 3-6 months, before further treatment is required.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>What are the side effects?</h4>
                        <p>It is a relatively safe drug when used correctly. We will discuss the rarer side effects during your initial consultation. Common side effects can include swelling, redness, bruises and pain at the site that we inject. Less commonly you can get flu-like symptoms, infection, facial/eyelid droop, dry eyes and very rarely anaphylaxis.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Dermal Fillers </h3>
                        <h4>What are dermal fillers?</h4>
                        <p>These are usually hyaluronic acid (HA) based fillers. They are non-prescription gel-like injectables, inserted into the skin layers. HA helps to draw in fluid from the tissue around where it is injected, helping to trap water and give a natural plumping effect.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>How do dermal fillers work?</h4>
                        <p>When, for example injected into the lip, they can increase the size. If injected into any fine/deep lines, they can increase the volume just beneath the skin, making those lines softer and less noticeable. The good thing with dermal fillers is you can see the results straight away, although you may have some swelling for the first 24 hours post procedure.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>What are the chances of it going wrong?</h4>
                        <p>When used correctly, it is very rare that things will go wrong. We always make sure that it is injected into the correct layer of the skin, and never into one of the vessels of the face. You may notice some bruising and swelling after the treatment, but these should settle down. We will discuss in detail further side effects at your consultation.</p>
                        <p>If your unhappy about the fillers, you can always have any HA filler taken out immediately if you do not like it. An enzyme called hyaluronidase can be injected into the area to dissolve the filler, giving you an instant reversal.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>How often should I get the treatments done?</h4>
                        <p>Treatments usually lasts 4-6 months. You may need to enhance areas slowly, and build up the volume of filler used across several treatment sessions, to ensure a natural result is achieved.</p>
