                            A Canadian banker approached me to help build a prototype of an application idea he had, he wanted to have something to show to his stakeholders during his pitch. His idea was to create a point-based mobile wallet that individuals can use to manage their day-to-day spending.

                               Helping the customer in developing his business model, gave me the opportunity to understand the users, business, the competitors, the industry and the market better. Using this data I proceeded to start developing the persona, focusing on their needs and how they currently meet these needs, what Zipay can do to make it better.

                                I first created an online survey to get an idea of the common pain points experienced by small businesses, I focused on necessity based businesses like barbing salons, one stop shops, carpenters and so on, and the factors that influence their decision-making process on geting and keeping customers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I then moved on to the users, I ran a quick focus group with family and friends, focusing on their dailys spending choices, businesses they visit everyday, or once a week.
                                
                                We also discussed plaforms they use for savings, spending, and if they use point based systems, and which ones they liked. 
                                Using the data from the focus group I was able to compile five key questions and create a survey through google forms, I targeted other classes of people I did not enougb data from in my focus group and send out the form through google forms.
                                
                                Due to time contraints I needed the result in 48 hours so I used Amazon gift card as incentives to get quick results.

                               I analysed data gathered from the market, customers and business, and using this data I compared the technology required to build the application. I then had a discussion with the customer about the possibility of development and platforms to consider, after our discussion It was agreed that I was to focus on an IOS application first, this is primarily because of Aesthetics, as the customers current requirement is the ability to present a beautiful prototype that can wow the investors.
