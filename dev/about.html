					<h1 class="fw-light">About me</h1>
					<p class="">
          <strong>2000</strong> - Surfing the internet and discovering the power of DOS, pinging networks and learning how to connect two desktops 
            to each other. ü§î
          </p>
          <p class="">
          <strong>2003</strong> - Tinkering with mobile phones, and pocket pc OS with the guide of XDA Developers, 
            able to hack network locks, and navigate core files, fix many OS problems.  ü•∑   
          </p>
          <p class="">
          <strong>2004</strong> - started fixing software and hardware issues on devices, primarily Windows mobile, HTC devices, desktops and laptops. üòè
          </p>
          <p class="">
          <strong>2006</strong> - Learning web and graphic design while interning at a tech company (The Noah 69 Company): 
             I started developing my graphic design and website development skill while trying to figure out which of these two 
             skills I really want to stick to. ü§ì
          </p>
          <p class="">
          <strong>2007</strong> - Registered a web and graphic design company (Impro Studio) offering both software and hardware services: 
            Due to the demand for my hardware skills I always had jobs primarily on the early iPhones, due to slow networks 
            in Nigeria people had allot of issues with network on their phones, how to use an apple iPhone, and also find it
             impossible to do a 1 Gigabyte  software update, which I solved by downloading IPSW‚Äôs and installing them, and many
              times some of these customers also want a software service, sometimes in systems while other times in web. 
              This led to branding and website development.
          </p>
          <p class="">
          <strong>2009</strong> - Applied to study Creative arts at University of Lagos but ended up being given psychology because ‚Äúyour secondary
             school results does not put you in the category of creative arts, your choice of study is, Botany or Psychology‚Äù.
              I was advised by my boss to study psychology because it helps with digital marketing, and I did. While studying 
              psychology in Unilag, I was studying the same course for free on Harvard University website, this led to me discovering 
              that the modules I was learning was ancient and I got so irritated, after finishing my Harvard course I found a software 
              company teaching, character design and animation, applied but was told by the manager that the course was to start a year 
              after, then I was tricked into Software engineering, I sold all I had, dropped out of Unilag as I did not see the value of
               being there, and started my software engineering journey, hardest and most challenging journey of my life.
          </p>
          <p class="">
          <strong>2013</strong> - Since I am a registered company, I started taking apple device management contracts for companies,
             In this role I manage other companies apple devices both physically and remotely, fixing hardware and software problems,
              As I find myself many times at mobile network company offices (Etisalat/Glo Nigeria) to fix data issues, 
              I started helping the customer services attendants fix their customer problems because most of the time they had no idea
               what to do on an iPhone, I easily become friends with many of the branch managers which led to having a simple business
                arrangements, their customer service reps can call me at any time to help fix an issue but if the issue is beyond them 
                the customer comes to my office and pays for my services or I go down to the companies office and get payed by the company.
          </p>
          <p class="">
          <strong>2015</strong> - started developing the passion in bringing ideas to life, I decided I was going to start developing businesses and 
            selling them.  I took my first responsibility as a UX designer without knowing I was; I noticed the number of bottles being 
            used in the country was getting out of hand, there is bottles everywhere I look. The worst  part is that people get hurt 
            intentionally (Fights) and unintentionally (Accidents) with it. I had to figure out a way to reduce its availability in the 
            streets. I did a little research and realised It can be reused as many useful tools. I purchased bottle cutting tools, 
            thought myself to cut bottles, cut some bottles into drinking cups, romantic table lamps, flower pots etc, took them to hotels,
             bars and florists for quick user testing research. All of the businesses I met were so excited about the product they placed 
             orders I could not meet for weeks, this was because the bottles were cheaper than cups, and customers break these cups allot. 
             I expanded on the idea, created a system for cutting, refining and cleaning the bottles without exposing my I.P for replication,
              registered a company, designed the work area and I was in business. It was a fun time which did not last because I got the 
              opportunity to go to middlesex University London around that time.

          </p>
          <p class="">
          <strong>2016</strong> - Finally discovered UX in my final year project at Middlesex University London, and a beautiful life begins.
          </p>
          <p class="">
            <strong>The moral of the story: </strong> There is a saying I picked up from the book NLP by O‚ÄôConnor & Seymour ‚ÄúAn artist, 
            a lumber jack and a botanist taking a stroll through the woods will have a different experiences and see the 
            woods from different point of view‚Äù. I believe all that journey and experience has led me to this moment, 
            all the accumulated experiences as a psychologist, software developer, hardware engineer, entrepreneur, and project manager,
             has led me to become a better product designer with the ability to see through the eyes of the stakeholders.
