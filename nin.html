                                Many diasporans find it challenging to register, renew or recover their documents and identity cards while abroad, namely passports, driver's licences, and so on. For example, in the UK, Agencies are registering Nigerians for their National Insurance number, but to locatte the agency  needs a bit of work and you will have to go to the office pysically to use the service in whatever location they are at.

                                Green Wallet is a company that wants to alleviate these challenges by providing an informative, and multi-service platform that solves all of these problems in one place, their first service is a National Identification Number registration service aimed at Nigerians in the UK, the registration will be done on the platform while they use Vans as mobile offices to capture biometrics.

                                 For me to build a multi-service platform, I had the task of figuring out how document and I.d agencies operate. with this, in mind, I set out to research the first business that will launch with the platform.  Nigerians are required by their government to register for National Identity Number before they can go back or do anything within Nigeria.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After researching all the information available in the public domain, I then travelled from the UK to Nigeria to complete my research, I reached out to the government agency that created the National Identity management system. I tried to have a meeting with the director general but only succeeded in getting a meeting with the consultant that helped build the system, through him I got most of my remaining questions answered.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These answers covered all the government requirements to register diasporans abroad, the type of companies that can meet the requirements and how they will make their money while offering the service. This led to a clear understanding of the complete business process and gave me enough data to work with and figure out the business side of the platform I will be building.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With this information in hand, I looked at the pattern of operation of three other government document services that will be a part of the platform. These are namely Passport support, Drivers licence, and bank verification number service.

                                All the governmenr agency business processes follows a simillar pattern; You fill a form online or in office and then get your biometric captured, the agency then sends the information to the government, when your document is ready, your document gets sent to the agency or directly to you.

                                The problem is faced both at home and abroad, most of the time users find it difficult to locate a service that will solve their problem without travelling, facing bad weather, spending outside their budget, or bad customer service.
                                Most of the competitors require a form to be filled online, and some documents are submited physically.
                                There is not much use of technologies to make these services easier on the user.

                                The business requirements is simple, create a platform that can manage an all-in-one service, The business processes data shows that there is primarily a form to be filled, payment to be made, and a profile to be managed, I researched the technology, and marketing requirements, I decided the platform will be built on Flutter, a build once and deploy everywhere platform, as the marketing does not require a strong S.E.O, which Flutter does not currently support, I decided to build the platform as an in browser web application which uses all platform elements and allows for installation of  the app from a browser. As the project evolves, required securities and features can be easily implemented and deployment can be easily done on IOS and Android app stores if needed.

                                With a clear understanding of the business goals, processes, requirements, and assumptions, I focused on the users and how I can figure out ways they will interact with the platform, what they expect versus what the platform offers, and what I need to do to balance them out.

                                After planing and compiling my survey, I started by asking friends and family about their experience while registering for NIN. Then I spoke to otthers who are not yet registtered to find out more about their knowledge of the requirements and what their plan is for registration.

                                With the research of four different services in hand and a customer survey for one of the services, I was able to move forward to see how the customer can navigate these several services on a single platform and make a buying decision.

This helps me think closely about the development requirements and constraints, and the best approach to designing the application with development capabilities in mind. At this stage I research the devices, operating system, and technical ability of my demography and list a test checklist, which includes but not limited to:

                                During the research phase, I came across a few agencies that were interested in the project and this influenced the business goals, some of the influences were the addition of a digital currency feature that will encourage the spending of your country's currency on the platform while abroad. Some of these influences led to evaluating the features and prioritising things of high importance that need doing and leaving the rest for future updates.

                                One of the ways I solved choosing and sticking to key features was by using the "Buy a feature" game: This is a simple and effective game for getting people to choose features they would like to see in the finished project. Ideally, your players are prospective users - but it is just as valuable with a client.

                                Many of my design decisions were made with the customers in mind. Choosing a left and right navigation to reach individual and corporate services gave us a better result than a single vertical scroll menu.

                                The company will sometimes partner with other businesses or government agencies to bring their services to the platform.

                                I had to figure out how to share this information with the user without causing information overload.

                                The companies mission statement is to offer a professional service with transparency, I focused on that and used it to design a terms and agreements screen that a customer will come across on first use of each service, this is first presented as a summary of the terms for a quick read through, and then a link to the full terms for deeper understanding.

                                Each service has a piece of information or a form that the user has to fill out, I ran an A/B test on two options, the ability for each service to navigate to a new screen or quickly pop a modal that displays information.
                                The modal had more positive results on users, it quickly pops up on the same screen and can be dismissed easily, it also made accessing some secondary menus really easy to implement.

                                One of the key requirements for the project is the ability to implement notifications for services, news, and blogs, the channels that receive the notification data are the news section, in-app notifications, and email.

                                After A/B testing two news screen options, the most favoured option was to display the news below the services on mobile and the right of the desktop. This option still gives a good experience even when other services are added and it goes beyond the screen, this is because the profile section holds your saved articles and you also get news notifications directly in your profile.

                                Initially, I implemented a simple form for the project, due to time constraints, but after reviewing market trends, I decided its best to implement an interactive form, I created a high-fidelity prototype in Axure, which allows me to create a wireframe and prototype at the same time with a function as close to the development version as possible. After a few A/B testing and feedback from users, it was decided to be left for future updates, this was because the results were similar for both forms.

                                The desktop menu was a voluntary option to leave the menu at the bottom of the screen, this is because the app is an installable desktop application and emerging trends show that even web browser menus will move to the bottom in the next three years.

                                The Secondary menu is designed to be fixed at the bottom for desktops but on mobile phones, it moves to the top with the activity menu, and the menu type changes according to the pages you visit.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The activity menu holds all input and output, it can popup and show activities you need to do for each service you choose.
                                These choices are based on validated results during testing.

                                Security is a massive part of an application that holds users private data. The platform files are planned to be encrypted using 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) the platform uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) to protect data in transit between the apps and its servers. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My job is to use design to re-enforce this and assure customers that their data is secure, The simplest solution I settled for was using the padlock and key icon on each heading, and a caption that reminds the customer of the security feature of every page, with the ability to read further on these features.
